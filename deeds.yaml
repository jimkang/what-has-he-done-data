    <blockquote>Trump’s version is a radically expanded one, as reporters have
    begun to notice. In the past, foreign N.G.O.s had to accept the conditions
    set out by the Mexico City Policy in order to get funds from two stipulated
    sources: U.S.A.I.D. and, after 2003, the U.S. State Department. But Trump’s
    version extends the requirement to global aid furnished by all U.S.
    governmental departments and agencies. This is both sweeping and, in the
    Trumpian way, very confusing to the people trying to do their jobs in the
    federal government. It could potentially affect an enormous range of health
    activities that the United States government engages in around the world,
    including work combatting H.I.V. and many other infectious diseases, and
    promoting maternal and child nutrition.</blockquote>
