  name: The State Department’s entire senior management team resigns

  description: >
    They were taking on responsibilities and working with the transition team, as if they planned to keep serving, but after a meeting with Tillerson, they suddenly resigned.
    <blockquote>“It’s the single biggest simultaneous departure of institutional memory that anyone can remember, and that’s incredibly difficult to replicate,” said David Wade, who served as State Department chief of staff under Secretary of State John Kerry. “Department expertise in security, management, administrative and consular positions in particular are very difficult to replicate and particularly difficult to find in the private sector.”</blockquote>

  name: Trump cuts funding to aid organizations that offer abortion counseling
  stamp: 2017-01-23
  description: >
    <blockquote>Trump’s version is a radically expanded one, as reporters have begun to notice. In the past, foreign N.G.O.s had to accept the conditions set out by the Mexico City Policy in order to get funds from two stipulated sources: U.S.A.I.D. and, after 2003, the U.S. State Department. But Trump’s version extends the requirement to global aid furnished by all U.S. governmental departments and agencies. This is both sweeping and, in the Trumpian way, very confusing to the people trying to do their jobs in the federal government. It could potentially affect an enormous range of health activities that the United States government engages in around the world, including work combatting H.I.V. and many other infectious diseases, and promoting maternal and child nutrition.</blockquote>

  name: Trump orders Dakota Access Pipeline environmental reviews stopped
  stamp: 2017-01-25
  description: >
    <blockquote>In December, the US Army Corps of Engineers rejected the permit that the project needed for its completion.
    <p>But on Tuesday, Trump signed a series of directives aimed at speeding up the pipeline's approval process. One of them ordered an end to what he called "incredibly cumbersome" environmental reviews. Those reviews are seen by many government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, as well as environmentalists, as cornerstones to ensuring the environment is taken into account when new construction projects are ordered.</p>
